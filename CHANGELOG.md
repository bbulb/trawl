# Changelog

All notable changes to trawl will be recorded here. Format loosely
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). trawl does
not yet follow semver strictly — expect breaking changes before
`1.0.0`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **C9 — Per-host adaptive content-ready ceiling.** New module
  `src/trawl/host_stats.py` tracks the last 50 Playwright fetch
  durations per hostname. `fetchers/playwright.fetch()` and
  `render_session()` now consult `host_stats.ceiling_ms(url,
  default=wait_for_ms)` before opening a context; after 5
  observations the wait ceiling switches from the static 5000 ms
  default to `p95 × 1.5`, clamped to `[1500, 15000] ms`. Observations
  below `MIN_OBSERVATIONS` fall back to the caller-provided default,
  so new installs behave identically until a host warms up.
    * On-disk JSON at `~/.cache/trawl/host_stats.json` (atomic
      rewrite, corrupt/schema-mismatch recovery).
    * Observations above `MAX_CEILING_MS × 2` or below zero are
      discarded as sanity checks.
    * New env vars `TRAWL_HOST_STATS` (default `1`, set `0` to
      disable recording and fall back to the static ceiling) and
      `TRAWL_HOST_STATS_PATH` (default
      `~/.cache/trawl/host_stats.json`).
    * `render_session()` consults ceilings but doesn't record —
      caller holds the session arbitrarily long.
    * 21 unit tests in `tests/test_host_stats.py` cover warm-up
      threshold, bounds, rolling-window eviction, sanity filter,
      corrupt-file recovery, and env disable.
  Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-20-c9-per-host-ceiling-design.md`.
- **C8 — Per-fetch result cache.** New module `src/trawl/fetch_cache.py`
  caches successful HTML/PDF fetches to
  `~/.cache/trawl/fetches/<sha256>.json` keyed by URL. Subsequent fetches
  within the TTL skip Playwright + Trafilatura entirely; chunking,
  embedding, retrieval, and enrichment still run fresh (query-specific).
  Expected savings: ~2-5 s per warm repeat visit (60-70% of total
  latency on repeat_visits workflows).
    * `PipelineResult.cache_hit: bool` exposes reuse for telemetry /
      assertion authors (new field, default `False`, no MCP API change).
    * New env vars `TRAWL_FETCH_CACHE_TTL` (default 300, set `0` to
      disable), `TRAWL_FETCH_CACHE_PATH` (default
      `~/.cache/trawl/fetches`), `TRAWL_FETCH_CACHE_MAX_MB` (default
      100, soft cap with mtime-based LRU trim).
    * Profile fast/transfer paths, passthrough branches, and error
      results are never cached — each has a distinct invalidation
      mode that MVP scope excludes.
    * Atomic file writes (`tempfile` + `os.replace`). Corrupt or
      schema-mismatched entries are skipped and deleted on the next
      read.
    * 21 unit tests in `tests/test_fetch_cache.py` + 7 pipeline
      integration tests in `tests/test_pipeline_cache.py`. No live
      infra required for either.
  Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-20-c8-per-fetch-cache-design.md`.
- **C16 — Compositional payload enrichment.** New module
  `src/trawl/enrichment.py` derives four lightweight metadata fields
  from existing extraction output (no LLM, no network) so agents can
  chain follow-up fetches without re-parsing the markdown payload:
    * `excerpts` — top-3 chunks' first-sentence summary, char-capped
      at 120 (handles ko/ja/zh sentence terminators, strips markdown
      markup).
    * `outbound_links` — markdown `[text](url)` references from the
      emitted chunks, dedup'd, hard-capped at 50 entries / 10 KB.
      Image refs excluded.
    * `page_entities` — noun-phrase candidates pulled from `page_title`
      + chunk `heading_path` (English Capitalised n-grams + Korean
      Hangul runs), 20-entry cap.
    * `chain_hints` — per-host follow-up dict for arxiv / github /
      wikipedia (en/ko/ja) / youtube / stackoverflow. Empty for
      unknown hosts.
  Backward-compatible: all four `PipelineResult` fields default to
  empty containers; legacy callers see no behaviour change. MCP
  responses include the new fields automatically (via `to_dict`).
  Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-19-c16-compositional-payload-design.md`.
- **Agent-patterns assertion DSL — C16 enrichment keys.** Extends the
  `tests/agent_patterns/` assertion whitelist with four keys that let
  pattern authors verify the compositional payload directly:
    * `excerpts_min_count` — `int` or `">= N"`, measured against the
      `excerpts` field length.
    * `outbound_links_contain_any` — `list[str]` of substrings
      matched against each link's `url` or `anchor_text`.
    * `page_entities_contain_any` — `list[str]` of substrings matched
      against the emitted `page_entities`.
    * `chain_hints_has_key` — `str`, the expected top-level key in the
      `chain_hints` dict.
  Applied to the two `workflows.yaml` compositional patterns so arXiv
  / GitHub host-specific `chain_hints` (`pdf_template`, `raw_template`)
  and minimum excerpt counts are now live assertions.
- **C7 — PDF Content-Type HEAD probe.** `fetchers/pdf.probe(url)`
  performs a small HEAD request before launching Playwright when the
  URL does not match the existing `.pdf` / `/pdf/` suffix heuristic.
  When the response Content-Type is `application/pdf`, the pipeline
  routes to `pdf.fetch()` instead of rendering the PDF viewer chrome
  through Chromium. New `fetcher_used` value `pdf-probed` distinguishes
  this from the suffix-hit path. Probe failure (HEAD 405, timeout,
  network error) silently falls through to the existing HTML path —
  C7 must never make trawl slower than before. Closes the
  ARCHITECTURE.md "Future work #4" item. Mirrors the existing
  `passthrough.probe` pattern.
- **VLM profile prompt v2 and mapper noise filter.** The VLM prompt
  now instructs the model to pick mid-paragraph text instead of section
  headings (which duplicate in sidebar TOCs) and explicitly warns about
  sidebar/nav text duplication. The mapper adds a noise-region filter
  that deprioritises anchor matches inside `<nav>`, `<aside>`, elements
  with sidebar/toc/breadcrumb classes, or ARIA navigation roles. This
  prevents LCA collapse to `<body>` when sidebar entries match heading
  text. Profile eval results on 36 diverse sites: success rate 89% to
  92%, IDEAL selectors 10 to 16 (+60%), docs category 67% to 100%.
  Parity matrix stays 12/12.
- **Benchmark suite (`benchmarks/`).** trawl vs Jina Reader (r.jina.ai)
  comparison framework with 12 test cases across docs, wiki, news,
  product, QA, finance, and blog categories. Measures latency, token
  count, and ground truth accuracy across three trawl modes (base,
  profile-gen, cached-profile) vs Jina. Key finding: trawl produces
  23x fewer tokens than Jina on average with comparable accuracy
  (11/12 vs 12/12 GT). Profile adds further compression on structured
  pages (e.g. Google Finance -88%, MDN -77%, BBC News -71%).
- **Profile evaluation suite (`benchmarks/profile_eval.py`).** 36-case
  evaluator recording VLM response, anchor matching, LCA path, and
  selector quality for prompt tuning iteration.
- **Slot pinning for shared llama-servers.** New env vars
  `TRAWL_VLM_SLOT` and `TRAWL_HYDE_SLOT` inject `id_slot`
  into request payloads, letting trawl pin requests to a dedicated
  llama-server slot. This prevents KV-cache eviction of other
  consumers on shared servers with prompt caching enabled. Unset by
  default (server assigns slots).
- **Cross-encoder reranking via bge-reranker-v2-m3** on
  `localhost:8083`. On by default; retrieves 2x candidates then
  rescores with the cross-encoder. Falls back gracefully to
  cosine-only if the server is unavailable. Adds ~0.5-2s latency.
  New env vars: `TRAWL_RERANK_URL`, `TRAWL_RERANK_MODEL`.
  New MCP parameter: `use_rerank` (default `true`).
- **Unified env var naming.** All environment variables now follow
  the `TRAWL_{COMPONENT}_{PROPERTY}` convention. Renames:
  `EMBEDDING_BASE_URL` → `TRAWL_EMBED_URL`,
  `EMBEDDING_MODEL` → `TRAWL_EMBED_MODEL`,
  `RERANKER_BASE_URL` → `TRAWL_RERANK_URL`,
  `RERANKER_MODEL` → `TRAWL_RERANK_MODEL`,
  `LLAMA_SERVER_URL` → `TRAWL_HYDE_URL`,
  `HYDE_MODEL` → `TRAWL_HYDE_MODEL`,
  `TRAWL_PROFILE_VLM_*` → `TRAWL_VLM_*`.

### Changed

- **HyDE default endpoint moved from `:8080` to `:8082`.** The original
  spike pointed HyDE at a main large-model llama-server, but on
  typical shared setups that endpoint's slots are reserved for
  another consumer (e.g. a chat agent). A HyDE call there would
  contend for a slot and, on models with known KV-cache-reuse
  issues, evict active chat caches. The fix: point HyDE at `:8082`,
  a small utility llama-server dedicated to auxiliary tasks.
- **HyDE now passes `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking=False`.**
  Without this, Gemma 4's reasoning-mode response burns the token
  budget on internal reasoning and returns empty `content`, forcing
  us to fall back to `reasoning_content` which sometimes contains
  meta-reasoning bullets instead of a clean answer. With the kwarg,
  the E4B utility model answers directly in ~1-2 seconds. The
  `reasoning_content` fallback stays as a safety net.
- **`HYDE_MAX_TOKENS` lowered from 800 to 300.** The reasoning budget
  is no longer needed.
- Documentation updates in `CLAUDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `README.md`,
  and `examples/{claude_code_config.json, mcp_gateway_config.yaml}` to
  reflect the new endpoint and explain the slot-contention reasoning.

### Defaults

| Env var | Old default | New default |
|---|---|---|
| `TRAWL_HYDE_URL` (was `LLAMA_SERVER_URL`) | `http://localhost:8080/v1` | `http://localhost:8082/v1` |
| `TRAWL_HYDE_MODEL` (was `HYDE_MODEL`) | `gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-Q8_0.gguf` | `gemma-4-E4B-it-Q8_0.gguf` |

No code change to the pipeline or fetchers; the 11/11 parity matrix
still passes (HyDE is off by default, so the changed defaults only
matter when a caller explicitly sets `use_hyde=True`).


## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-10

Initial release. Packaged form of the selective-extraction spike
plus the A/B Firecrawl-replacement spike that followed it.

### Added

- `src/trawl/` — the pipeline library
  - `fetch_relevant(url, query, k=?, use_hyde=?)` as the single entry point
  - Playwright fetcher with playwright-stealth wrapper for Cloudflare
    passive challenges
  - PDF fetcher via httpx + PyMuPDF
  - Three-way extraction (Trafilatura precision + recall + BeautifulSoup
    fallback, longest wins)
  - Heading-scoped chunker with sentence-level fallback for single-line
    inputs (e.g. PDFs)
  - bge-m3 cosine retrieval with adaptive top-k (7/8/10/12 by chunk count)
  - Optional HyDE query expansion (off by default)
- `src/trawl_mcp/` — stdio MCP server exposing a single `fetch_page` tool
  - Runs the sync pipeline in a worker thread so `sync_playwright`
    doesn't collide with the asyncio event loop
  - Returns a JSON payload with chunks, timings, compression ratio,
    and error state
- `tests/test_pipeline.py` — parity matrix, 11 cases, exits non-zero
  on any regression
- `tests/test_mcp_server.py` — spawns `python -m trawl_mcp` as a
  subprocess and walks `initialize → list_tools → call_tool`
- `tests/test_cases.yaml` — 11 golden cases carried over from the
  extraction spikes (KBO schedule, Wikipedia ko/ja, Naver news
  ranking, Notion pricing, Playwright docs, Paul Graham essay,
  GitHub README, arXiv PDF, Stack Overflow, example.com)
- `examples/claude_code_config.json` — drop-in MCP server entry for
  Claude Code's `mcp_servers.json`
- `examples/mcp_gateway_config.yaml` — mcp-gateway style config snippet
- `README.md` — user-facing quick start, usage, testing
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — design rationale, measured performance, spike
  provenance
- `CLAUDE.md` — project rules for Claude Code sessions working in
  this directory
- `LICENSE` — MIT
- `pyproject.toml` — package metadata, `trawl-mcp` console script

### Known limitations at 0.1.0

- Cloudflare-hardened sites with active challenges (Turnstile,
  DataDome) are not handled; passive JS challenges work via stealth
  at a ~10-20s latency cost per fetch
- Fetcher serialises on a module-level lock — fine for single-user
  setups, will need a browser pool for multi-tenant deployments
- No PDF OCR; scanned documents return empty chunks
- Auth/paywall pages are fetched but return the login page, not the
  content
- URL-suffix heuristic for PDF detection (`.pdf` or `/pdf/`); a
  `Content-Type` HEAD lookup would be more robust

See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full list and workarounds.

### Test matrix at 0.1.0

11/11 cases pass. Measured with bge-m3 on llama-server :8081 locally
on an M-series Mac:

| Case | Tokens | Latency |
|---|---:|---:|
| kbo_schedule | 335 | ~6.8s |
| korean_wiki_person | 1151 | ~10.6s |
| korean_news_ranking | 1158 | ~8.3s |
| pricing_page_ko | 2110 | ~8.9s |
| english_tech_docs | 966 | ~6.1s |
| japanese_wiki | 883 | ~10.1s |
| blog_post_no_heading | 2010 | ~6.8s |
| github_readme | 1466 | ~7.8s |
| arxiv_pdf | 1644 | ~5.2s |
| stackoverflow_question | 1138 | ~24.0s |
| very_short_page | 49 | ~6.1s |

Average ~1174 output tokens / ~9.2s. Stack Overflow's Cloudflare
challenge dominates the latency average; excluding it, ~7.7s.
